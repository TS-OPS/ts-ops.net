# Hello World!
Im happy to tell you that we have the website up and running! New CMS, new look, new us!

## Meet us!
While this is still building up, you can find us on other places, too!

  * You can always find us in our loved irc channel: [#exploders on irc.mibbit.net](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.mibbit.net/exploders "I hope someones online if you click here...")! 
  * We have a [forum](http://forum.ts-ops.net "Thanks to pomp")
  * We have a [mumble](mumble://mumble.ts-ops.net) where probably, outside of events, noone is online. 

Have a nice day!
