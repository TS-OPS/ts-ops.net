# The Status

What is the status you might ask? Why are you on this website?

### Steamgroup
We are on steam, and [you can join us there now!](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ShitpostOps)
Get these fancy notifications that tell you when we're about to host some game night stuff. Shitpost with us! Weeeheee! Oh... that reminds me..

### Gamenights
At the moment we (*cough* irregularry *cough*) host gamenights. The plan is to go for one every 2-3 weeks. 
The games we are playing will include everything from good "old" TF2 to Diabolo, DOW, maybe even CS:GO... everything you want!

### Show your stuff! (pls do)
Maybe you have an awesome project? Maybe you have a comic or some sofware you want to promote somewhere? 
Maybe you hope, as wee do, that this place will grow in the future? 
Then you can talk to us in the irc and we might consider showing your projects off on this website! 
Help us creating an awesome and open community of gamers, hackers, artists and everything! 

### Logo
And we fixed the logo. AND WE'RE 3D NOW! CANT YOU SEE IT?

Thats whats planned at the moment.

Have a nice day/week/year/[enter timeframe here]! <br>
